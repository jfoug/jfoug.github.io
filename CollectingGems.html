In the game Evony, Kings Return, Gems are the lifeblood of the game. With enough gems, anyone can be the king (for as long as they want).  Need a Keep of level 35, NO PROBLEM.  Just spend some (a LOT) of gems, and boom, there you are.  Wow, see all those great generals.  Want them all.  "No problem"  Just fork over enough gems for gold, and buy them all.  Wow, getting powerful now, arent we!!!  Those level 14 (XIV) troops sure look sweet, but we need millions.  Easy, just keep forking over all those gems.  Wow, we are so powerful.

Ok, time to leave the fantasy.  What we did above was to make the developers of evony rich beyond their wildest dreams. If instead you would like to KEEP your money and be rich yourself beyond your wildest dreams, then we need some ways to get those gems.   Lucky you, you have found the right page for that information.

Ole Codgers Maximal Free Gems : A howto guide for keeping your money in your pocket, but still getting plenty of gems (Plenty for 3 day truce bubbles, lol).

There are many ways to get gems in the game. The fantasy listed at the start is one way.  Simply turn REAL money you have into the games fake money (the gems). Yes, this method works 100% of the time.  It takes no game play time. BUT it makes you poorer while transfering your money to the games developers. This is not a 100% bad thing.  The games developers have put a LOT of hard work into creating and maintaining the game.  Some spending now and then is not a bad thing, and this guide does not try to discourage that.  This guide is written for the non 'whale' player.  The whale player (P2W or pay to win) simply spends, gets very powerful and tries to win.  I am a F2P (free to play) so have made sure to find all possible ways to squeeze out as much of the the games fake money as I possibly can.

Sources of Gems.

1. Crazy Eggs (one of the best sources)
2. Offering tribute in the Shrine
3. Gathering at Gems tiles (actually not really a good source but it's there)
4. Event Center / Monarch competion.
5. World Boss Event
6. Undead Invasion
7. Kings Path event  (Day 2 "try your best")


Crazy Eggs Howto (best methods).

In crazy eggs there are 3 locations of gems.  The 3 hammer (100), the 12 hammer (1000), and the final activation (2000). A usual return for the proper full run of the eggs will get you 4400 gems (100 x 2 for 3 hammer, 1000 x 2 for 12 and the 2000 final chest).  You can get more than this from a final success, if the 3 hammer, or 12 hammer fail to activate and require additional hits.  However the 4400 target is really what should be expected.

1. collect hammers, lots of hammers. Do not start following process until you have 75 or more.
2. wait until just after the servers' date changes. Do this since you may need some time.
3. since we have plenty of hammers (see step 1), crack all 4 eggs IN THIS ORDER.    12 hammer, 3 hammer, 6 hammer, 8 hammer.
4. wait.  DO NOT crack any eggs again until they all have completed the cooldown. The longest cooldown is the 12 hour, so NEVER continue until the 12 hour is ready
5. Perform step 3 again, in exact same order.
6. This time, many (often times ALL) eggs will activate.  If not, it should only be 1 egg left. 
7. If any egg left, simply wait for it to activate and re-crack.  Hopefully it will activate and the 2000 gem bonus will be got.
8. If not, wait and do it again.
9. Go back to step 1 (collecting 'enough' hammers).

During Crazy eggs (usually a 10 day event), getting 2 full activates is usually very easy. getting 3 is easy if you are active. getting 4 or more takes work.  Often things like using stamina packs to hunt more monsters.  Also some monsters are more likely to drop hammers (research needed!!!)  So getting 8800+ in 10 days is very easy (anyone should do that.  That is 10.5 days of bubbles in 10 days, peace out.....    (no, we have a bit more, lol).  3 sets is 13.2k  Enough for 16 days.  4 full sets (yes, this is doable if you try hard), will get you 21+ days of 24/7 bubble.

now since crazy eggs is not going all the time (but runs a lot), it can either fill ALL of your bubble needs or a fairly large percentage, all by themselves.   HAPPY hammer hunting :)


Offering:  Best methods  (WIP!!!)

Offerings get several things.  First they give you prestege and monarch power.  Each time you offer you get some. Each time you offer in the same day you get more prestege (higher value each time), so if you offer multiple times in a day, each follow up offering is more valueable.   HOWEVER, offerings cost gems (do not use offering tokens until later play in the game, save them up).  So it is a very big trade off for gem growth.

Offering gives gems in this manner.
1. you get enhanced rewards (daily for full week).  (WIP) how exactly this works, an what are min requirements
2. offerings are part of the daily tasks, (but this is not gems).
3. offerings makes small amounts of gems show up above the wall (WIP, make sure this is true).


Gathering at gem tiles.

I personally do not recommend this. It appears to be a great way to do it, however I personaly think there are much better ways to use your time and troops. Gem collecting is very slow (6 + some bonus per hour). Also gem collecting COSTS stamina (your fighting food).  So pick your gem collecting wisely. The higher the level of gem mine, the more gems there are (and longer you have to encamp your troops). BUT the higher the gem mine value, the more it cost to send troops there to collect.  

I personally find gathering gems should only be done if you need no other items (food, ore, wood, iron). Gathering those resources to continue to grow I find much MUCH more productive. BUT if you really need to mine gems (you are out and need gems RIGHT NOW to bubble), then mining is one way to do it.


Event Calendar:  Monarch competion.

The monarch competion is an event that is continual.  It is a weekly event. There are 4 1 day (24 hour) events, and 1 3 day 'kill event'.  Each of these events has 3 parts.  You get points for doing certain things (gathering outside city, training troops, etc).  Last 3 days is killing enemy troops.  Each part gets you rewards (3 parts). You will see a thermometer bar showing where you are at within the day's competion.  The 3rd (final) rank gets you gems. These gems dump right into our gems to use bucket. Every day one should see what is required and work to get to those gems.  They are well worth it, and the tasks performed also keep you growing.


World Boss Event.  

The World Boss  (WB), is a weekly event.  The world boss is a contest, both personal and alliance wide to inflict the most damage possible against the world boss. TAKE PART each week.  Send as powerful of a team, even going as far as boosting your rally size every way you can, boosting your attack power (every way you can). Also make sure to coordinate a huge rally march against this monster.

You have 5 free hits against the monster each week.  MAKE SURE to use them all.  Even a march of just 1 troop gets rewards. These rewards are 200 gems and 50k gold (not sure on gold amount).  So there are 1000 gems just waiting to be scooped up each week.  NEVER miss out on these.

Also, at completion of the WB event, you get 2 rewards. 1 is your personal award. So if you inflicted 1400 damage yourself (your best attack value), you will rank X place (say 125th). You will get the rewards for that placing. In there, one of the items is GEMS.  The higher you rank, the more you get.  Same goes for the alliance. In the alliance, the strongest 'rally' hit is used. All members get prize. It is based on server wide ranking of your alliance and the max damage that was caused. Again, one of the returns you get is GEMS!!!     

NOTE, if you leave the alliance in the middle of the WB event, you will NOT receive the solo, or alliance rewards, so if you are jumping between sister clans, WAIT until after the WB event ends.


UNDEAD Inasion.

This is similar to the WB event, other than you do not get 5 attacks. Invasion is 20 'waves' of undead troops, where each wave gets stronger and stronger.  Our allicance JD2 is working to coordinate this event. Be sure to prepare, and be ready, both to get the best score you can, AND to get best score possible for the alliance.  Again there are 2 ending rewards, and each contains gems.  There is personal reward (how high your score is), and alliance reward (what rank on the whole server your clan was).  There are instructions given by clan elders (and a how to sheet), so do what is asked, and get the rewards.  Like the WB event, DO NOT leave alliance after your invasion attacks and before the event ends.  Doing that will forfeit the rewards (cry.... you lose out on those shiny gems and more).


Kings Path event.

On the Event center, Kings Path, on day 2 there is a 'try your best' event that pays out gems (good pay).  This event is the 'consume stamina' event.  Be sure to collect ALL coins from this.  If you miss collecting them you lose them.  Some of the final goals in this task WILL require you to use stamina (VIT) chests. Those are also very precious resources (like gems), so keep that in mind if you plan on using them. When you are out of those, you are out.  You can gain more of those chests, but only slowly (unless you use gems, lol).  I find getting as many as I can, making sure to try to keep my stamina under 100 ALWAYS, so that it is recoving and making more is the way to go.  Also, stamina is 100% refreshed at the very start of each day (this is a different topic but fits here).  One good way to grow stamina is to make SURE you completely use it all right before the change of the server date (best is just minutes prior to the date roll).  THEN at date roll, you will get full 100 instantly.  You should again immediately use "some" (could use all). I live where the sever day changes at 2 am (middle of the night).  So if I play this way, I wake up about 1:45, burn all stamina, then at 2:00 am, I get it all.  Since I will be sleeping shortly after, I then (after 2 am), burn a lot of stamina (almost all).   NOTE, there usually are big players who KNOW this. They log on and start rallies at this time. It is often easy to simply join in on these rallies and burn some of that free stamina.   For me (2 am guy), I burn it, then go back to bed.  When I wake up, stamina is much more full (I am up before it is fully full). So all night long, it was regenerating. I missed none of that.  Then in morning I use some more, enough so that stamina regenerates until my first break at work, etc, etc.  Doing this means stamina is growing constantly, SO at the end of the week (well all throughout the week), I have climbed as high as possible on this day 2 'try your best' event, and netted as many free gems as possible.


Well thats enough for now.  If you know of any other 'free' ways to collect gems, pass them on to me, and I will get this document updated.  Also, I am 100% sure there are some things I have listed where I have the facts wrong. This was written in the middle of a couple nights (lady of the house hates the game so I try to work on things when she is asleep).  So if you see something not 100% correct, let me know.  Best way to let me know is in game (whisper) or mail in game.   I am 'Ole Codger'  from the JD2 clan.  See you in-game :)
